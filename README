A Proof-Of-Concept for using a database backend with celery via SQLAlchemy. Tested only with SQL Server (on linux using pyodbc/unixODBC/FreeTDS) on linux. The model doesn't work with sqlite.

To try,
- pull the repo
- modify the alchemy_backend.py to use the right connection information
- start celeryd (e.g., "PYTHONPATH=. celeryd")
- run try_celery.py
